* **Complete Mini Message Support**: Complete support for Mini Message `<gradient>` colors.
* **PlaceholderAPI**: Native support for PAPI placeholders in prefixes, suffixes, and hover text.
* **Interactive Chat**: Configurable Hover events and Click actions (e.g., click to DM).
* **Moderation**: Built-in tools to Lock and Clear the chat.

While most of the project was made by myself and some help from my team,
this project still utilised the use of Artifical Intelligence in the cleanup & final touches of the code
